# youth-power-karnataka-data-analysis
An end-to-end data pipeline analyzing regional development vectors across Karnataka. This project features a custom XPath-based scraper to extract multi-dimensional metrics, followed by Sklearn regression modeling and Plotly geometric visualizations. 
### Engine: Python 
### libraries: Selenium, plotly, Sklearn, pandas, numpy

#### Karnataka Youth Power: 
  Data Convergence AnalysisAn end-to-end data engineering and EDA project that extracts regional development metrics and maps the "vector distance" between district infrastructure      and academic performance.

#### Project Overview
  This repository utilizes a custom XPath-based scraper to navigate the Youth Power website's DOM structure. By targeting dynamic elements through formatted scraping paths, we          extracted multi-dimensional vectors for 30+ districts. The project then applies Scikit-Learn regression to analyze the correlation between infrastructure capacity and efficiency      nodes.

#### Tech StackData Extraction: 
  Python, Selenium (Dynamic Path Injection)Modeling: Sklearn (Linear Regression)Visualization: Plotly & Matplotlib (Geometric Vector Design)Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy, Scipy

#### Key Findings: 
  The Efficiency-Capacity MeshOur regression model identified a weak but positive correlation ($r \approx 0.17$) between infrastructure investment and test scores. This suggests that   academic performance is a "multivariate vector" influenced by factors beyond just physical assets like libraries and colleges.
